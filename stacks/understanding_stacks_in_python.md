# Understanding Stacks in Python

A **stack** is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and also remove from the top.

## 1. Introduction to Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.
The principal operations are:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.

**Characteristics:**

- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**: The last element pushed onto the stack is the first one popped off.
- Used in various applications like function call management, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.

## 2. Stack Operations

The fundamental operations performed on a stack:

- **Push**: Insert an element on top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- **Peek/Top**: Return the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: Return the number of elements in the stack.

## 3. Implementing Stacks in Python

Python doesn't have a built-in stack data type, but you can implement a stack using lists or the `deque` class from the `collections` module.

### Using a List

Python lists can serve as stacks since they support adding and removing elements from the end.

```python
# Initialize an empty stack
stack = []

# Push operation
stack.append(item)

# Pop operation
item = stack.pop()

# Peek operation
top_item = stack[-1] if stack else None

# Check if the stack is empty
is_empty = len(stack) == 0

# Get the size of the stack
size = len(stack)
```

**Note:** While lists are efficient for stack operations, they can be less efficient than `deque` for large data sets due to memory allocation.

### Using `collections.deque`

The `deque` (double-ended queue) is optimized for adding and removing elements from both ends.

```python
from collections import deque

# Initialize an empty stack
stack = deque()

# Push operation
stack.append(item)

# Pop operation
item = stack.pop()

# Peek operation
top_item = stack[-1] if stack else None

# Check if the stack is empty
is_empty = len(stack) == 0

# Get the size of the stack
size = len(stack)
```

### Creating a Custom Stack Class

Creating a custom class allows for more control and readability.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def isEmpty(self):
        return not self.items
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
        print(f"Pushed {item} onto the stack.")
    
    def pop(self):
        if self.isEmpty():
            print("Stack is empty. Cannot pop.")
            return None
        item = self.items.pop()
        print(f"Popped {item} from the stack.")
        return item
    
    def peek(self):
        if self.isEmpty():
            print("Stack is empty. Nothing to peek.")
            return None
        return self.items[-1]
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

**Example Usage:**

```python
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(f"Top element is {stack.peek()}")
stack.pop()
print(f"Stack size is {stack.size()}")
```

**Output:**

```
Pushed 1 onto the stack.
Pushed 2 onto the stack.
Top element is 2
Popped 2 from the stack.
Stack size is 1
```

## 4. Practical Examples

### Reversing a String

You can use a stack to reverse a string by pushing each character onto the stack and then popping them off.

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        stack.append(char)
    reversed_s = ''
    while stack:
        reversed_s += stack.pop()
    return reversed_s

print(reverse_string("Hello, World!"))  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH
```

### Checking for Balanced Parentheses

Stacks are useful for checking if an expression has balanced parentheses.

```python
def is_balanced(expression):
    stack = []
    pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in '([{':
            stack.append(char)
            print(f"Pushed {char} onto the stack.")
        elif char in ')]}':
            if not stack or stack.pop() != pairs[char]:
                print(f"Unbalanced at character {char}")
                return False
            print(f"Popped matching opening brace for {char}")
    if stack:
        print("Unbalanced - Stack is not empty at the end.")
        return False
    return True

expr = "{[()()]}"
print(f"Expression '{expr}' is balanced: {is_balanced(expr)}")
```

**Output:**

```
Pushed { onto the stack.
Pushed [ onto the stack.
Pushed ( onto the stack.
Popped matching opening brace for )
Pushed ( onto the stack.
Popped matching opening brace for )
Popped matching opening brace for ]
Popped matching opening brace for }
Expression '{[()()]}' is balanced: True
```

## 5. Summary

- **Stack**: A linear data structure following LIFO.

- **Implementation in Python**:
  - **List**: Simple but can be less efficient for large datasets.
  - **`deque`**: Optimized for frequent additions/removals.
  - **Custom Class**: Offers more control and clarity.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Reversing data.
  - Undo mechanisms.
  - Syntax parsing.
  - Function call management.
